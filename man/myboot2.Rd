\title{Bootstrap confidence intervals for a statistic}
\usage{
myboot2(iter = 10000, x, fun = "mean", alpha = 0.05, cx = 1.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{Integer. Number of bootstrap replications. Default is 10000.}

\item{x}{Numeric vector of data values.}

\item{fun}{Character string giving the name of the function to apply
to each bootstrap sample. Default is "mean".}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for the confidence interval.
Default is 0.05 (for a 95\\% CI).}

\item{cx}{Numeric. Character expansion factor for text on the plot.
Default is 1.5.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical arguments passed to \code{\link{hist}}.}
}
\value{
An invisible list with components:
\code{ci} (numeric vector of length 2 with the lower and upper
confidence limits), \code{fun} (the name of the statistic used),
and \code{x} (the original data vector).
}
\description{
This function performs a nonparametric bootstrap on a numeric vector \code{x}
to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic (e.g. the mean),
and returns a bootstrap confidence interval along with a histogram.
}
\details{
The data vector \code{x} is resampled with replacement \code{iter} times.
The statistic specified by \code{fun} is computed for each resample,
forming an empirical bootstrap distribution. A two-sided
\code{(1 - alpha)} confidence interval is constructed using the
corresponding quantiles of this distribution.

A histogram of the bootstrap statistics is also plotted, showing
the bootstrap distribution of the statistic, the point estimate from
the original data, and the bootstrap confidence interval.
